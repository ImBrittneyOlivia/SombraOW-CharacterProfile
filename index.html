            <h1><i>Everything can be hacked...and everyone</i></h1>
            <p>One of the world's most notorious hackers, Sombra uses information to manipulate those in power.</p>
            <p>Long before she took up the alias "Sombra," ░░░░░░ was among the thousands of children who were left
                orphaned in the aftermath of the Omnic Crisis. With much of her country's infrastructure destroyed, she
                survived by utilizing her natural gifts with hacking and computers.</p>
            <p>After ░░░░░░ was taken in by Mexico's Los Muertos gang, she aided it in its self-styled revolution
                against
                the government. Los Muertos believed that the rebuilding of Mexico had primarily benefited the rich and
                the
                influential, leaving behind those who were most in need of assistance.</p>
            <p>Following her many conquests, ░░░░░░ was supremely confident in her skills, but she was caught
                unprepared
                when she stumbled into the web of a global conspiracy—one that had also noticed her. With her security
                irreparably compromised, ░░░░░░ was forced to delete all traces of her identity and went into hiding.</p>
            <p>She later reemerged as Sombra, upgraded and determined to find out the truth behind the conspiracy she
                had
                uncovered. Sombra launched an even more audacious string of hacks, and her exploits earned her no
                shortage
                of admirers, including Talon. She joined the organization's ranks and is believed to have contributed
                to
                its massive cyberattacks against corporations with strong ties to their governments. These efforts
                incited
                a popular revolution in Mexico against LumériCo and breached the security of Volskaya Industries, the
                manufacturing arm of Russia's anti-omnic defense.</p>
            <p>Now, with Talon's extensive resources to call upon, Sombra can focus on her true goal: to unravel the
                conspiracy and use the power behind it to her own ends.</p>
